        "* Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to finding good models. \n",
        "* However, Keras is more restrictive than the lower-level frameworks, so there are some very complex models that you would still implement in TensorFlow rather than in Keras. \n",

        "until your height and width dimensions are quite low and your number of channels quite large (≈32 for example).  \n",
        "You can then flatten the volume and use a fully-connected layer.\n",
        "- Use MAXPOOL after such blocks.  It will help you lower the dimension in height and width.\n",
        "- Change your optimizer. We find 'adam' works well. \n",
        "- If you get memory issues, lower your batch_size (e.g. 12 )\n",
        "- Run more epochs until you see the train accuracy no longer improves. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**: If you perform hyperparameter tuning on your model, the test set actually becomes a dev set, and your model might end up overfitting to the test (dev) set. Normally, you'll want separate dev and test sets.  The dev set is used for parameter tuning, and the test set is used once to estimate the model's performance in production."
