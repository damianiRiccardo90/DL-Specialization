had been fabricated at the Zeppelin plant at Akron, arrived by the
train-load to be assembled in the big dome-shaped shed just outside
Bellevue.

On this particular spring morning, Andy was in his office just outside
the hangar, pouring over the set of blueprints for the big gondola which
was being assembled for the forward end of the dirigible. He was
engrossed in the blueprints and failed to hear Bert Benson, who was to
be chief radio operator on the Goliath, enter the room.

â€œHello, Andy,â€ said Bert quietly.

The unexpected greeting startled the young aircraft engineer and he
jumped involuntarily. When he saw that his visitor was Bert he grinned
sheepishly.

â€œSorry I jumped like that,â€ he said, â€œbut weâ€™ve been having so many
mishaps in the last two weeks my nerves are on edge.â€

â€œI know it,â€ replied Bert gravely. â€œItâ€™s been just one thing after
another. First something goes wrong here and then something turns up in
another part of the plant. Seems as though there was a hoodoo on this
valley.â€

â€œI wouldnâ€™t exactly call it a hoodoo,â€ said Andy, â€œbut weâ€™ve certainly
been having our share of tough breaks. Iâ€™ll be glad when Dad and Captain
Harkins get back from Akron. Then weâ€™ll be able to give more of our time
to closer supervision of the plant and these accidents may be stopped.â€

The words were barely out of Andyâ€™s mouth when Bert, who had been
looking toward the far end of the hangar, gripped the young engineer
hard.

â€œLook, Andy,â€ he cried, â€œone of the doors at the other end of the hangar
is opening!â€

Andy looked in the direction Bert pointed. There was no mistake. One of
the huge â€œorange peelâ€ doors which sealed the ends of the hangar was
swinging back on the railroad track on which it was mounted.

â€œSomethingâ€™s gone wrong down there,â€ said Andy sharply. â€œA crew is
working on top of that door this morning. They may be brushed off if
that door isnâ€™t stopped at once.â€

Bert realized the danger to men working on the top of the 225 foot, 600
ton door, and he nodded grimly. There was something decidedly wrong, for
specific orders had been issued that the doors were never to be opened
unless Andy or Capt. Harkins were at the controls of the motors which
moved the giant doors.

â€œCome on,â€ cried Andy. â€œWeâ€™ve got to stop that door.â€

They left the office and jumped into Andyâ€™s roadster which was parked
nearby. With a clashing of hastily shifted gears, they roared along the
outside of the hangar. While they dashed toward the end, the door
continued its slow, relentless movement. At the top they could see a
half dozen men clinging to the girders. The control room for the doors
was on the other side and Andy whipped his roadster around the end of
the hangar. He was out of the machine before it stopped and raced toward
the motor room with Bert at his heels.

There was no one at the control board and the powerful motors were
humming softly. With one swift movement Andy shut off the power and the
great door stopped.

â€œRun outside and tell that crew on top of the door to hang on for
another five minutes,â€ Andy told Bert. â€œWarn them to hold on tight when
I start rolling the door in.â€

The radio operator departed on the run and Andy, looking through a
window, saw Bert megaphone with his hands and shout the warning to the
desperate crew clinging on top of the door.

Andy threw over the controls and turned on the motors. He let the clutch
which operated the door mechanism in easily and the great â€œorange peelâ€
moved slowly back into place.

While the motors sang at their task, Andyâ€™s mind was busy over this near
tragedy. It could not have been an accident by the furthest stretch of
the imagination for motors do not start all by themselves and clutches
do not jump into place without a guiding hand. In the last two weeks
there had been one minor accident after another. It had been maddening.
The Goliath was scheduled to make its trial flights in two more months
and there wast much remaining to be done. Each little delay meant
valuable time lost and Andy had about come to the conclusion that a
deliberate attempt was being made to delay the construction of the great
ship. He promised himself that there would be a thorough investigation
of this latest incident.

The door finally rolled into place and the half dozen men who had been
in danger of their lives quickly climbed down to a place of safety.

Andy disengaged the clutch and shut off the motors. Bert returned and
they made a thorough inspection of the little room but found nothing
which would identify the man who had started the motors.

â€œNow Iâ€™ll tell you why I came into your office,â€ Bert told Andy after
they had securely locked the control room. â€œLast night someone tampered
with my radio equipment and broke up a lot of it.â€

Andyâ€™s lips snapped into a thin, straight line.

â€œHow much damage was done?â€ he asked.

â€œNot as much as I first feared,â€ replied Bert. â€œAs luck would have it
whoever used the hammer destroyed experimental equipment and the
installation for the Goliath is almost intact. He must have been an
amateur at the job or he would have singled out the set for the Goliath
and smashed it.â€

â€œWhat youâ€™ve told me and whatâ€™s just happened,â€ said Andy grimly, â€œmakes
me positive that there is a well-defined plot under way to injure the
Goliath in every way possible. I thought we had a hand-picked crew that
couldnâ€™t be bribed but it looks like I was wrong.â€

From the timber-covered hills behind the hangar came the sharp crackle
of rifle fire, which was followed by a tense quiet as every man in the
great hangar stopped work. When the rifle fire was not repeated, the
crews slowly resumed their work and Andy and Bert headed for the hills
on the run.

Since the Goliath had been partially financed by a government
appropriation and its construction embodied secrets valuable to the war
department, a military guard had patrolled the construction site from
the day the hangar had been completed and the actual assembly of the
dirigible started. On a number of occasions they had apprehended men
trying to make their way into Bellevue and without exception the secret
service detail at the hangar had found them to be agents of foreign
governments. They had been quietly sent to military prisons but in the
last few weeks there had been no such arrests and the vigilance of the
guards had been relaxed somewhat.

Andy and Bert were half-way up the slope to the guard line when they met
Merritt Timms, chief of the secret service unit at Bellevue, coming down
the hill.

â€œAnybody hurt at the hangar?â€ asked Timms anxiously.

â€œNo,â€ replied Andy. â€œWe stopped the door in time. What happened on top
of the hill?â€

â€œThe guard had to stop a man who was trying to get away,â€ explained
Timms. â€œIâ€™ve been suspecting one of the motor mechanics for some time of
sabotage and only ten minutes ago saw him sneak out of the control room
door. A second later one of the doors started to open and I knew what he
had been up to. I saw you coming to shut off the power and I took after
this fellow. He knew heâ€™d have to make a quick get-away and he tried to
get past the guard line.â€

â€œDid he refuse to stop?â€ asked Bert.

â€œNot only that,â€ replied the secret service chief, â€œbut he attempted to
shoot and the guard fired, but he wasnâ€™t seriously wounded.â€

â€œI canâ€™t feel very sorry for him,â€ said Andy, â€œwhen I think of the
half dozen men, on top of the door, he almost killed. If the door had
run to the end of its track with the power still on it would have ripped
away from its fastenings and perhaps have crushed an end of the hangar.â€

â€œWhich is exactly what this chap wanted,â€ added Timms. â€œIâ€™ve got a
little leather packet here in which he carried some secret papers. Weâ€™ll
have a look at them.â€

The name on the leather folder was that of Cliff Bolton, a common enough
American name, but the secret service man and Andy and Bert were in for
a surprise when they examined the contents. Documents there showed the
true name of the spy to have been Boris Dubra, an agent of the dreaded
Rubanian Gerka, whose reputation for unscrupulous methods was known even
in Bellevue.

â€œThis puts a new angle on the whole case,â€ said Timms gravely. â€œOf
course you know that Alex Reikoff, dictator of Rubania, is determined
that his air force shall be the most powerful in the world. Until just
now we hadnâ€™t discovered a single Rubanian agent trying to get through
the lines but it certainly looks as though Reikoff is definitely
interested in the Goliath, all of which means we will have to redouble
our vigilance.â€

â€œBut why should Reikoff have designs against the Goliath?â€ asked Bert.

â€œItâ€™s a long story,â€ replied the secret service chief, â€œbut to boil it
down it means that he plans to make Rubania a world power through the
development of a great air force. When his planes and dirigibles are the
peer of anything else in the world, he will strike out for world power.â€

â€œWhich would mean another war,â€ said Andy quietly.

â€œJust exactly,â€ replied Timms, â€œand when the Goliath is completed and in
the air it will dwarf even the great dirigibles Reikoff has turned out
at his Blenkko plant in Rubania. Now you understand why the Rubanian
secret police, or Gerka as it is better known, is interested in the
Goliath. So far weâ€™ve been pretty successful in checking sabotage and
this mechanic was the only man they could get into the plant.â€

â€œHe was enough,â€ said Andy, â€œfor had his plan succeeded and the door
have crushed an end of the hangar we might have been delayed for
months.â€

They walked slowly back toward the hangar, discussing further the events
which had just taken place and planning for the tightening of the guard
lines around the plant.

â€œAs soon as this agent of the Gerka is patched up in the hospital Iâ€™ll
go over and give him a thorough grilling,â€ said Timms as they reached
the hangar.

â€œLet me know when you go,â€ said Andy. â€œIâ€™d like to see what he has to
say.â€

â€œIâ€™ll do that,â€ promised the secret service agent as Andy and Bert got
into the young engineerâ€™s roadster.

When they reached the little building which served as Andyâ€™s office,
they found a messenger boy with a telegram for Andy.

â€œMust be from Dad,â€ he said as he ripped open the envelope, â€œand believe
me Iâ€™ll be glad to have him back here in charge of things.â€

Andy scanned the telegram; then he read it again hardly able to believe
the words which were typed on the yellow sheet.

â€œWhatâ€™s the matter?â€ asked Bert anxiously.

â€œNothing wrong,â€ grinned Andy, â€œbut itâ€™s news, big news!â€ With eyes
aglow and face reflecting his own enthusiasm he handed the telegram to
Bert.

â€œRush work with all possible speed,â€ said the message. â€œHave just
completed plans for Goliathâ€™s first official flight this summer which
will take us to North pole for an exchange of mail with the Submarine
Neptune, which will be commanded by Gilbert Mathews.â€

â€œMy gosh,â€ exclaimed Bert, â€œa trip to the North pole. Well, that is
news.â€

â€œIâ€™ll say,â€ replied Andy. â€œWatch us make time from now on for there
wonâ€™t be any more accidents with this Rubanian secret agent out of the
way.â€

The change of the seasons was at hand and the last dirty patches of snow
melted under the rays of the March sun. Andy spread the news that the
first official flight of the Goliath would take it into the polar
regions and the crews inside the lofty hangar were filled with new
enthusiasm and energy. They were making history, placing America in the
forefront of the air-minded nations, and they thrilled at their task.

In the afternoon Andy helped Bert check over the damage which the agent
of the Gerka had done to the radio apparatus and they were greatly
relieved to find that the set intended for installation on the Goliath
worked perfectly.

When Andy returned to his office, Bert accompanied him and they
discussed the outlook for the polar flight.

â€œIt will be a real test of the Goliath,â€ said Andy, â€œand it means weâ€™ll
make plenty of trial flights before we undertake a cruise into the
northland.â€

â€œWhy do you suppose your father decided on such a daring trip?â€ asked
Bert.

â€œThere has been some criticism of the government for appropriating a
part of the money necessary for the construction of the Goliath,â€
explained Andy. â€œThis was especially true when it became known that the
dirigible would eventually be used for transcontinental passenger
traffic. What most people do not realize is that the Goliath will be a
veritable airship of the skies, a craft that can be turned from a
peace-time airship into an aerial battleship if the United States is
ever attacked by an enemy force. With its enormous cruising radius of
15,000 miles without refueling it will be able to scout far from our
own shores and uncover the approach of any enemy fleet.â€
